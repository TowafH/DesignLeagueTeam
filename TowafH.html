  <h3>Stronger and Greener Communities</h3>
  <p>This theme is important to me because it is important to take care of our communities, whether it be the environment or the people living within the community. This game that I am making will hope to have a positive impact by encouraging the people to take care of their communities and be engaged in them!</p>
