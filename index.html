  <h3>About This Project: </h3>
  <p>Recycle House is a game that addresses the issue that a lot of places around the world does not take seriously. As we see everyday, many people throw out their trash and leave it wherever they want. This is very harmful to the enviornment in several different ways. To tackle this, we asked ourselves, how can we change peoples minds and help them understand the uses of the things they throw on the ground? So we created this game. </p>
